# Adding React Router to a React Native app

If you're just getting started with React Native, we recommend you follow [the
Getting Started guide for React
Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) to get everything up and
running.

Then, use `yarn` to add React Router to your React Native project:

```
$ yarn add history@5 react-router@6 react-router-native@6
```
